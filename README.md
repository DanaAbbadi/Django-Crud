## Description

Adding CRUD functionality to Blog app, using Django Framework.

## Problem Domain

Handling forms is a complex business. Consider Django’s admin, where numerous items of data of several different types may need to be prepared for display in a form, rendered as HTML, edited using a convenient interface, returned to the server, validated and cleaned up, and then saved or passed on for further processing.

Django’s form functionality can simplify and automate vast portions of this work, and can also do it more securely than most programmers would be able to do in code they wrote themselves.

In this repo, the three distinct parts of the work involved in forms which are handeled by Django are:

* Preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
* Creating HTML forms for the data
* Receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client
